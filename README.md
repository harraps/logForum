# logForum
minimalistic forum made to run on cheap servers !

The goal of this project is to create the most minimalistic forum ever
without cutting off the most important functionnalities.

the forum is expected to have a old-school style while still being responsive.
Pictures will be allowed but with a dithering black&white effect.
